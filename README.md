# Medha-AI

Democratize ML AI Knowledge and sample projects

This repository mainly to build expdertise in Artificial Intelligence. 

# Week1 ( 24th December, 2019 )

Objective -   Understand Supervised learning, Support Vector Machine Algorithm to classify digits data (using scikit learn tutorial) and develop a ML Model to predict phishing websites using UCI's phishing website dataset .  

Solution :  Refer the detailed solution ( Phising_Predict.ipynb )

Try to download the dataset provided by the PhysioNet and use any one of the supervised machine learning algorithem ( SVM, RF, Logistic Regression etc ) and predict whether the ICU patient will be classified as Sepsis or not. 

# Week 2:  

Objectives : Learn about Decisison Tree Classifier and Random Forrest Classifier

Try the same dataset and use Random Forrest Algorithm and classify the URLs and predict the accuracy.

Refer : Phishing-RF.ipynb. ( solution using RF )
